# absolute-cent

## notes

scientific notation: A4, C0, B2#

notes in scientific notation span from C0 and there are 128 semitones, which matches the MIDI specification

frequency for scientific notation is derived from an anchor point: A4 = 440, A4 = 432

1 cent = 1/100 semitone

1 octave = 1200 semitone

n Hz + 1 semitone = n * (12th root 2) Hz

n Hz + m semitone = n * (12th root 2) ^ m Hz

n Hz - m semitone = n / (12th root 2) ^ m Hz

A4 = 4 * octave + 9 semitone

C0 = 0 * octave + 0 semitone

4 octave + 9 semitone = 4 * 12 semitone + 9 semitone = 57 semitone

C0 = A4 - 57 semitone = 440 / (12th root 2) ^ 57 Hz = 16.35159â€¦ Hz

0 absolute cent = C0 = 16.35159 Hz, if A4 = 440 Hz
